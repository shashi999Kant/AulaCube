Creating a well-structured README file is crucial for guiding developers, users, and contributors through your project. Below is a template for a README file for your Employee Management System project:

# Employee Management System

Employee Management System is a Spring Boot application that allows you to manage employee and department data. The system integrates both PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases and provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for employees and departments.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete employees and departments.
- Store employee data in PostgreSQL and department data in MongoDB.
- Exception handling with custom exceptions and global exception handler.
- Unit and integration tests for ensuring reliability.
- RESTful API design for easy integration with other systems.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Spring Boot
- PostgreSQL and MongoDB installed and configured
- An integrated development environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-management-system.git

3. Import the project into your preferred IDE.

4. Configure the application properties for your PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

5. Run the application.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with it through API endpoints.

## Endpoints

- `GET /employees`: Get a list of all employees.
- `GET /employees/{id}`: Get an employee by ID.
- `POST /employees`: Create a new employee.
- `PUT /employees/{id}`: Update an existing employee by ID.
- `DELETE /employees/{id}`: Delete an employee by ID.
- `GET /departments`: Get a list of all departments.
- `GET /departments/{id}`: Get a department by ID.
- `POST /departments`: Create a new department.
- `PUT /departments/{id}`: Update an existing department by ID.
- `DELETE /departments/{id}`: Delete a department by ID.


## Exception Handling

We have implemented custom exception classes (`EmployeeNotFoundException` and `DepartmentNotFoundException`) and a global exception handler to handle exceptions gracefully.
